        One cup (165 grams) of fresh mango contains fewer than 100 calories and has a very low calorie density, meaning that it has few calories for the volume of food it provides.<br>
In fact, most fresh fruits and vegetables tend to have a low calorie density. One study found that consuming fresh fruit like mango at the start of a meal could help keep you from overeating later on in the meal.<br>

        Mango is a good source of immune-boosting nutrients.<br>
One cup (165 grams) of mango provides 10% of your daily vitamin A needs.<br>
Vitamin A is essential for a healthy immune system. Not getting enough of this vitamin is linked to a greater risk of infection.<br>
Plus, 1 cup (165 grams) mango provides nearly 75% of your daily vitamin C needs. This vitamin can help your body produce more disease-fighting white blood cells, help these cells work more effectively, and improve your skin’s defenses.<br>

        Mango contains nutrients that support a healthy heart.
For instance, it offers magnesium and potassium, which help maintain a healthy blood flow. These nutrients help your blood vessels relax, promoting lower blood pressure levels.<br>
Mango’s super antioxidant mangiferin also appears to be good for heart health.<br>
Animal studies have found that mangiferin may protect heart cells against inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell death.<br>
In addition, it may help lower your blood levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids.<br>

        Two key nutrients mangoes contain are the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin.
These are concentrated in the retina of your eye — the part that converts light into signals so your brain can interpret what you’re seeing. These nutrients are especially concentrated at the center of the retina, which is called the macula (46Trusted Source, 47Trusted Source, 48Trusted Source).
Inside the retina, lutein and zeaxanthin act as a natural sunblock, absorbing excess light. In addition, they appear to protect your eyes from harmful blue light.<br>
