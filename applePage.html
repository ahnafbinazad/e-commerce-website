    <article id='nutriArticle'>
        Our apples have a diameter of approximately 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) and offers the following nutrition:<br>
•	Calories: 95<br>
•	Carbs: 25 grams<br>
•	Fiber: 4 grams<br>
•	Vitamin C: 14% of the RDI<br>
•	Potassium: 6% of the RDI<br>
•	Vitamin K: 5% of the RDI<br>
To get the most out of apples, leave the skin on — it contains half of the fiber and many<br> of the polyphenols. <br>

    <article id='weightArticle'>
        Apples are high in fiber and water — two qualities that make them filling.<br>
In one study, people who ate apple slices before a meal felt fuller than those who consumed applesauce, apple juice, or no apple products. <br>
In the same study, those who started their meal with apple slices also ate an average of 200 fewer calories than those who didn’t. <br>
In another 10-week study in 50 overweight women, participants who ate apples lost an average of 2 pounds (1 kg) and ate fewer calories overall, compared to those who ate oat cookies with a similar calorie and fiber content <br>

         <h1 id='diabetesHead'>They’re Linked to a Lower Risk of Diabetes</h1>
        
    <article id='diabetesArticle'>
        Several studies have linked eating apples to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. <br>
In one large study, eating an apple a day was linked to a 28% lower risk of type 2 diabetes, compared to not eating any apples. Even eating just a few apples per week had a similarly protective effect. <br>
It’s possible that the polyphenols in apples help prevent tissue damage to beta cells in your pancreas. Beta cells produce insulin in your body and are often damaged in people with type 2 diabetes. <br>

        <article id='cancerArticle'>
        Test-tube studies have shown a link between plant compounds in apples and a lower risk of cancer.<br>
Additionally, one study in women reported that eating apples was linked to lower rates of death from cancer. <br>
Scientists believe that their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects may be responsible for their potential cancer-preventive effects. <br>
